  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <p>My name is <b>Belden Granada</b>, an artist from the San Francisco, Bay Area.
   <p>At 26, my work is reflective of themes of an individual at this age; yearning and longing, and a loathing towards wealth. My inspiration stems mostly from my interests; music, writing, and people.
   <p>I always strive to tell a story, that takes people away, that makes them believe â€“ even if just for a minute; I want to take people on a  journey, that makes them want to fight and fall in love.

   <p>If I can do that, then I did my job.
